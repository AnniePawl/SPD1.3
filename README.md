# The Mission
To squirrel something away means to stow it someplace safe, especially for future use. Inspired by the squirrel and its notable habit of storing acorns for later, *Squirrel Away* aims to help users cache and manage an assortment of online resources from important links and forms to inspirational images and custom notes.

As a student with mediocre organization skills and a proclivity for too many tabs, **Squirrel Away** really helps me store a myriad of links, along with helpful comments to remind me why I was looking at them in the first place.
